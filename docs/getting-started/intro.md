# üé® For designers

## üëã Hi BrightHR designer.

Set up your computer to be effective with Bright-UI.

### Tooling

We use Figma for all our entire design workflow. Since it‚Äôs a larger topic, we‚Äôve set up a set of guides on working with Figma.

### Use plugins to be more effective

You need to be careful with plugins as they sometimes slow down your work rather than speeding it up. But here are some Figma plugins that should make you even more effective and shouldn‚Äôt create any major issues.

[Get Autoflow](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733902567457592893/Autoflow)
An essential plugin to show flows in your groups. This makes it easy to connect screens into a clear flow with a single hotkey.

## üéØ Why this?

### Problems we are facing

The problems we want to solve, e.g.:

- Inconsistent design all over the apps = harder for cognitive load = takes more time to process information
- Current solution doesn't scale, a lot of UI is hand rolled resulting us reinventing the wheel and running tests over multiple versions of the same UI
- It is hard to adjust the current design according to the business needs in a sustainable way

### Benefits

How do we/users benefit from solving the problems, e.g.:

- No need to create high fidelity mocks all of the time, simple wireframes and a pointer to the component should be enough
- Improved usability & interactions
- Consistent customer experience across our entire product estate
- One component = easier and faster design, delivery, & maintenance
