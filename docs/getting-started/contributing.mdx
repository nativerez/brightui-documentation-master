# Contributing to BrightUI

Ask yourself a few questions:​

<TwoColGrid>

:::tip When to contribute towards BrightUI​:

- **Are your solutions repeatable?** If so, sharing them will help others work more efficiently and help make experiences feel more familiar. It will also open your solutions up to feedback — and help evolve your solutions.
- **Will understanding how you solved a problem benefit other teams?** If so, sharing your solution will prevent other teams from spending time trying to solve the same problem.​​

:::danger When to hold off from contributing:​

- If something is unique to a specific context and scenario, perhaps it doesn’t need to be shared with others. Check in with other teams to gut check — best to not make assumptions on whether you think something you’ve made is helpful to others.​
- For something to be part of the system it should go through multi-disciplinary reviews. For example, if it’s a component, it should be accessible, localization should be considered, content guidelines formed, and UX best practices outlines.​

#### The process (draft)

Design system work should be treated like feature work — if it’s more than a bug fix, create a full project around it. Start with a brief, identify stakeholders, and put time on your team’s roadmap for working on it. Make sure there’s alignment between all UX disciplines and Web/backend engineering on time and collaboration expectations.​

1. Designer updates the component in Figma
2. Designer publishes the changed component for other designers to consume
3. Designer consumes updated component in their design files to check its good
4. Designer updates the design documentation to reflect the changes
5. Designer approaches #bright-ui FE guild about implementing change
6. Appointed FE creates a ticket on https://brighthr.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/BUI1/boards/215 and picks up the changes
7. FE checks for breaking changes throughout the webapp to determine new version number (from https://semver.org/):
   - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
   - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
   - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
8. FE publishes changes
9. FE broadcasts the changes on the [#bright-ui channel](https://brighthr.slack.com/archives/C02JU9WUGAH) and/or writes up the component changes and release notes here... [Releases](../../blog)
10. FE guild consumes the updated component with an `npm update` in their own feature area
