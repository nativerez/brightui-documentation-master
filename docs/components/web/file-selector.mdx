# FileSelector

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

The file selector enables users to upload one or more files from their device.

### Structure

- **Dropzone** Rectangular box which files can be dragged into and dropped
- **Icon** A fixed upload icon
- **Hint text** Default text explaining how the control can be used
- **Browse button** Launches the file browser on the device, to allow files to be selected

    className="mb-10"
    onFilesSelected={function noRefCheck() {}}
    text="Drag and drop files here to upload"
  />
</SbExample>

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use when the user should be able to add one or more than one file from their device.

#### When not to use

- If only one file can be uploaded, use the file input control instead.

### Content

#### Hint text

- Use the default hint text unless you have a very distinct need to use something else.

### Interactions

- On dropping files in the dropzone - or confirming files to upload from the device file browser - a progress indicator should be shown.
- If one or more of the files fails to upload, an error panel should be shown near to the file selector.

### Accessibility

- The "Browse" button must be available, in a sensible position in the tab order, and accept keyboard focus.
