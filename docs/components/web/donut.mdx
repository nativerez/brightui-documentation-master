# Donut

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

The donut chart is a circular chart with a hole in the centre, used to display data as a proportion of a whole. The content in the middle of the chart can provide additional context that makes it easier to understand the data.

### Structure

- **Ring** The outer, coloured ring. Represents 100% of the data.
- **Segments** Two or more segments within the ring, representing proportions.
- **Text** Optionally, textual content - often a number - adding context to the data

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use to display data as a proportion of a whole. It can be effective in situations where you want to compare multiple sets of data or show progress towards a goal. Donut charts (and their accompanying animation) can add visual interest to dashboard and overviews.

#### When not to use

- Avoid using when there are a large number of data categories, or when you need to display precise numerical values. In these situations, a bar chart or a table may be more appropriate.
- Avoid using a donut chart when the data is not a proportion of a whole.

### Content

#### Specifying the centre value

- Add a number in the centre of the donut if
  - you are representing a single value in the donut
  - that value is short enough to be shown in the space available
  - the value is either self-explanatory is explained with accompanying text
- Include explanatory text in the centre along with the number if
  - it is not likely to be obvious what the number is representing
  - the explanatory text is short enough to be shown in the space available
- Include numbers in the form "data point/total" (e.g. 4/10) if
  - the importance of the number of incomplete / unfinished items is as high as the important of complete / finished items

#### Making it clear what categories are

- If using a donut chart, it must be clear what the categories in the chart represent. For this reason, favour using them for representing
  - single values as part of a whole, or
  - pairs of values that collectively make up the whole

If you use them for more than 2 categories, you must have an associated key indicating the categories associated with each colour.

#### Drawing

- In general, favour drawing in a clockwise direction (from empty to full). This direction supports the feeling of progress & completion.
- Draw in an anticlockwise direction (from full to empty) only when the value is something that users would prefer to be smaller / zero (e.g. absences).

### Accessibility

- Ensure that the colours used in the chart are sufficiently different to be discerned from each other, including by people with differing colour vision.
- Ensure that any information describing the categories or values in the chart is accessible to screen readers.
