# Accordion

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

### Structure

- **Caret:** Identifies when the accordion is open or closed. Pointing down in open. Pointing right is closed.
- **Title:** Identifies the title of the accordion.
- **Description:** Additional text to provide context to the accordion content.
- **Body:** Contains the content of an accordion.

<SbExample

  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Accordion"
  showLinks

<Accordion title="Accordion title" >
  <p>Accordion content is rendered here, by passing in a child element that can contain all the required content, such as text, buttons, images etc.</p>
  <Button text="Button title" size="lg"/>

</Accordion>

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- You have long sections of content with similar structure, such as employees within teams.
- You want to show only one section at a time (to keep users from being overwhelmed to support progressive disclosure).

#### When not to use

- You want to display all content on the screen at once—use a card.
- Each section has a single associated action—use a tile.
- The information to hide is simple and doesn’t have a repeating structure—use a collapse.

### Behaviour

TODO: Add behaviour and considerations associated avatars. The badge and avatar sizes should be the same.

### Accessibility

_Keyboard navigation considerations:_

Links must be keyboard accessible via the Tab key, show a clear indication when a header is selected and opened by pressing the Enter or space key. If a panel is collapsed the content of this must not be focusable by a keyboard until expanded.
The contrast ratio of focus indicators and the background must be at least 3:1

_Screen reader considerations:_

The accordian title should have a label to indicate that it can be clicked to open.

_Visual considerations:_

The contrast ratio between text on the accordian and the background must be at least 4.5:1
Users should be able to resize the accordian up to 200%.
