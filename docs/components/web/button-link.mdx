# Button Link

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

Displays a single, less important action a user can take.

### Structure

- **Text:** Conveys the action message relevant to the button.
- **Icon** (optional): Supports or directly communicates the text, can be left or right aligned.

<SbExample
  title="Primary button"
  storyUrl="https://storybook.bright.hr/?path=/docs/components-link--primary"
  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Link"
  showLinks
>
  <Link text="Link title" />
</SbExample>

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- To offer less important actions users can take.
- To show many possible actions at once.
- When the action is navigation inside the current app.
- If it involves an interaction (like opening a modal or submitting a form).
- With short action text.

#### When not to use

- When you have a single action you want to draw attention to—use a [button](./button).
- To make text inside paragraphs or lists actionable—use a text link.
- For navigation to external sites and services—use a text link.
- With a long call to action—use a text link.

#### Use apart from text

Button links have extra spacing built into them so that they present a large enough target size to be usable on smaller screens. So they have different heights than text and using them in a paragraph would cause visual misalignment.

Use button links only as stand-alone elements. The extra space around them also helps show they’re connected to an action. If you need links aligned with text, use text links.

### Content

#### Use actionable text

It should be clear from the button text exactly what happens when the user interacts with it. The labels should be actionable, such as “Add employee(s)” and “Save Report“.

Avoid long explanations in the button text. The text should be short and clear. If additional explanation is needed, add it above the button as text.

#### Button links with icons

Button links with icons are great when you need to draw more attention to the action. Icons add additional context and makes the button link easier to scan.

Whilst it’s essential to not overuse icons within buttons links, they can be used more frequently here than within [Buttons](./button). Do keep in mind, that if everything is grabbing attention, things usually get messy.

:::tip Use link colours for icons

An icon should be the same color as the button link it is next to to ensure consistency and visual coherence.

:::

:::tip Use left icons to add context

This can help to give the user visual clarity, by clearly communicating the purpose or action of the button link.

:::

:::tip Use right icons when the button is an external link or directional.

They can help explain what happens when the user interacts with the button. An icon (with an aria-label) makes it easier to know if the user is taken elsewhere. For cases like this, use the NewWindow icon and ensure the user is being taken away from site using a new tab (target="\_blank"}.

:::

:::tip Add a label when using icon-only buttons

Even the simplest icons like plus can be understood in many different ways. To make sure your icon is accessible, add a proper label to communicate the purpose.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard navigation considerations:

- Links must be keyboard accessible via the Tab key, show a clear indication when it is selected and actioned by pressing the Enter key.
- The contrast ratio of focus indicators and the background must be at least 3:1

#### Screen reader considerations:

- If you are linking to something from an image or icon, supply a title attribute to give people who use screen readers some context.
- Don't include the word 'Link' in your link. Screen readers tell the user when they encounter a link, so you don’t need to do this.
- Indicate when a link activates a download and include this in the link text.

#### Visual considerations:

- Do not rely on colour alone to indicate links, links should be visually different from other elements on the screen. If other elements on the screen look similar to a link we should consider if those need changing in order to better represent the element's purpose.
- The contrast ratio between the link and the background must be at least 4.5:1
- If the link is embedded within a sentence, the contrast ratio between the link and the surrounding text must be at least 3:1
- Users should be able to resize text links up to 200%.
