# Tooltip

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>


A tooltip is used to give more context to a specific element in our product. It is a good way of giving more context and conveying meaning through additional text, without polluting the base page with copy.

A tooltip can also be a good way to indicate what is expected next for clicking on a link

At heart it adds more context to the original element conveyed. For example, an ion could have an explanation behind a tooltip, if space is not available on the original page.

### Structure

- Tooltips usually include a text and optional title. They have a background (Margin:x-24 y-16. Background colour:Neutral-700)

### Guidelines

#### When to use

We use tooltips when more context is needed for a certain element in the UI, and we don't necessarily have the visual real estate on the current estate.

#### When not to use

WHen context on the original element is enough for users to understand. Or there is enough of a design judgement reason on the prior screen to include the context that may be hidden behind a tooltip.

#### Properties

 - ** Direction: ** Top, bottom, left, right (where the tooltip appears and is aligned.0 this should take into consideration different device sizes and whether important information would be hidden by the tooltip. )
 - ** Text alignment: ** CENTERED, lEFT (THIS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE TOOLTIPS TEXT BASED ON DESIGNER PREFERENCE0)
 - ** Size: ** Small, base (the small size is generally used based off the context it is around. So a smaller amount of copy probably dictates a larger tooltip, a large amount of copy will need to be condensed inside of the tooltip so can be done at a smaller size)

#### Use cases

Conveying more information than is required on the original display
When the original display is already over-polluted with copy and explanation

### Behaviour

The tooltip will appear on cursor hover. 
On mobile devices, the tooltip will not be available as hover capabilities are a non factor on mobile- we would use an information icon instead or convey more meaning on the smaller device

### Look & Feel

The tooltip should never be too large, there should be a character restriction of 50 characters. If the tooltip looks like it is exceeding this amount, consider using another ui element to communicate meaning.

#### Heading with subtext
Optional heading with subtext can be used to communicate meaning and more explanation behind what it means in the context of the product/situation.

#### No heading
Not all tooltips need headings; if sub text is enough to convey the message.
