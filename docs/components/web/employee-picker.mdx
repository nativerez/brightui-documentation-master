# Employee Picker (Teams)

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

Enables one or multiple employees to be selected, usually to be associated with something else (e.g. a rota, a team).

The employee picker (teams) is usually displayed in a modal.

- **Search box** Filters the list of employees by their name or team
- **Clear filter link** Clears the text our of the search box, if text is entered there
- **Select all/deselect all links** Selects or deselects all the employees listed in the picker
- **Selected accordion** Contain a count showing how many employees are selected and - when expanded - all the employees currently selected
- **Team accordions** An accordion for each team, showing how many employees are selected within that team. When expanded, shows all the employees in that team
- **Select team/deselect team links** Selects or deselects all the employees in that team
- **User card** A card for each employee showing their name, and optionally any error/warning text, with an icon in the top right corner indicating either selection or warning states.

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use whenever you need the user to be able to select multiple employees, especially if selecting teams of people is likely to be useful.

#### When not to use

- If the user only needs to select one employee, use the typeahead component
- If space is restricted consider the Employee picker (Simple) instead.

#### Defaults

If employees are already associated (for example, when editing a team), all the employees that are currently associated must be down as selected. Otherwise, no employees should be selected.

### Accessibility

It must be possible to tab into the employee picker and then through all the controls and employees in a sensible order, using the keyboard to select/deselect.
