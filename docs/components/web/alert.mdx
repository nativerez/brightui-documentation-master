# Alert

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

Breaks the main user flow to present information.

### Structure

- **Icon:** Optionally supports the message
- **Title:** Works best with 5 to 8 words
- **Description:** Optionally provides more context for the message, ususally when the message is long
- **Closable/Dismiss:** Optionally lets users close the message
- **Checkbox:** Used to fire additional actions or prevent a user dismissing without taking action
- **Actions:** Optionally adds related actions for users to take

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- When you want to interrupt a user’s journey with relevant information.
  For things like status messages and additional explanations.

#### When not to use

- When there are already many on the screen. Don’t overwhelm the user.
- For messages that shouldn’t interrupt the flow—consider heading and text.
- For temporary messages that don’t draw much attention—use a [Toast](./toast).
- When no results match a user query—use an empty state.
- When a user has to solve an issue as soon as possible—use a modal.

##### Variants

- Information
- Success
- Warning
- Error

##### Sizes

Available sizes: Large (with description), Small

### Behaviour

#### Use more than just color

To maximize accessibility, make sure the message is clear from the content. Icons can also support the message.
Color alone doesn't always distinguish different alert types.

#### Use icons

Without icons, people with color blindness might see success and critical alerts as the same.

#### Follow up with actions

There are times when just simple information isn’t enough and the user needs to take additional steps to resolve the problem or get additional details.

In such cases, provide additional actions for your message.

Use at most two actions in each Alert: one primary and one subtle. See more on the styles of the buttons and how they should be aligned.

### Accessibility

- An Alert should receive focus and use aria-live to announce its presence and allow a user to interact with it immediately.
- If sticky positioning is used, the user must still be able to access and view focusable elements the Alert may be covering.
- An Alert is separate from, but complimentary to validation error messages. In this way an Alert announces that there are validation errors and links a user to each instance.
