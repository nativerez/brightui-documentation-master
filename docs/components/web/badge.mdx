# Badges

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

Presents users with short, relevant information. Often this information should be important & distinguished from the rest of the display.

### Structure

- **Container:** Wraps the content.
- **Marker:** Indicates that the badge relates to a status.
- **Icon** (optional): Supports or directly communicates the metadata meaning, always left aligned.
- **Text** (optional): Conveys and supports the meaning or other attribute of the metadata.

  <Badge

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- To call attention to details in a way that makes it easy to scan.
- To present information, such as status or category.
  -When items need to be differentiated from each other.

#### When not to use

- If the entire message has an associated action—use an [alert](./alert).
- If the indicator can be removed or replaced, use a tag instead.

#### Colour Variants

- Default/Neutral
  - Colours: Grey colour ramp
  - Meaning: Can pertain to a default piece of information that we dont want a colour to distort meaning against.

#### Properties

- Sizes: XS / Sm / Base / Lg (should be considered in the layout with space available, these sizes should be consistent in similar areas of the product. We wouldnt use different sizes for the same badge function on the same feature page)
- Status marker: On/Off (Status marker indicates something is is in a process which could have distinct stages or phases that they go through)
- Icon: Leading/Trailing (Used to support the messaging in the badge, and differentiate when colours and type are not enough)
- Uppercase / Lowercase (Uppercase is used for something that may require to capture more immediate attention of the user)
- Background: Default, dark, light, white. (It is not recommended to mix emphasis without intention, and designers should consider doing so only where it serves to improve user understanding.)

#### Use cases

** Status badges **

##### Prop: With Flicker

Status badges utilise the marker property to signify that something in product is in a live state which is operational. It is used to represent a 'live' action such as a delegated session.
Example: BrightSafe delegatoin bar. Indicating a user is within a live delegation session with the blinking marker.

<SbExample
  title="Status badge with flicker"
  storyUrl="https://storybook.bright.hr/?path=/docs/components-badge--primary"
  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Badge"
>
  <Badge
    background="default"
    iconName="heart-filled"
    hasMarker="true"
    markerDoesBlink="true"
    size="base"
    status="default"
    text="Hello world!"
  />
</SbExample>

##### Prop: Static marker

Status badges utilise the marker property to signify that something in product is in a state that may change with action, or over time. It is used to represent a 'living' part of the product... such as a report & its completion status.
Example: BrightSafe Learning management. Indicates a status on a course- so a course has been assigned and it is currently in to-do status, which means it requires action from the user to change status.

<SbExample
  title="Static marker badge"
  storyUrl="https://storybook.bright.hr/?path=/docs/components-badge--primary"
  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Badge"
>
  <Badge
    background="default"
    iconName="heart-filled"
    hasMarker="true"
    size="base"
    status="default"
    text="Hello world!"
  />
</SbExample>

** Badges **

A badge can be used for many different reasons in product, a few are listed below.

- To indicate grouping or a type of elements
- To give more prominence to a certain element on the display

Example: BrightSafe e-learning courses. To denote a card belongs to e-learning feature and the information it holds relates to this.
Example: BrightHR uses badges as counter on tabs in various places, to draw more attention to a tab.

<SbExample
  title="Badge used as a counter"
  storyUrl="https://storybook.bright.hr/?path=/docs/components-badge--primary"
  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Badge"
>
  <Badge background="dark" size="base" status="notification" text="2" />
</SbExample>

#### Use in tables - widths

Status badges can be used in tables - most often to indicate the status of an item. When badges are used in a table, all badges in a column must be the same width, based on the width of the longest status that is possible in that column.

### Behaviour

#### Support with icons

With such small space to convey a message, visual cues can help users understand the idea more quickly. Use icons to display more information in a smaller size, such as the state of published job.

The badge can be only an icon. Just be sure to keep it accessible by giving it a label for people who don’t see the icon.

<SbExample
  title="Badge with icon"
  storyUrl="https://storybook.bright.hr/?path=/docs/components-badge--primary"
  gitUrl="https://github.com/brighthr/bright-ui/tree/main/packages/Badge"
>
  <Badge
    background="default"
    iconName="information"
    iconPosition="left"
    size="base"
    status="information"
    text="More info"
  />
  <Badge
    background="default"
    iconName="information"
    iconPosition="right"
    size="base"
    status="information"
    text="More info"
  />
</SbExample>

### Look & Feel

#### Badge types

There are six basic types of badges. All except white badges have an inverted variant for use with different backgrounds.

:::note Icon colours

Icons within the badge component are the same colour as text as but are reduced to 60% opacity so they don’t visually compete with the label. Graphics, and by extension icons are not held to the same contrast requirements as text.

:::

##### Neutral badges

Neutral badges present information without adding any emotion. They’re useful when the information isn’t so important to the user’s main flow.

##### White badges

White badges are useful when presenting neutral information within a dark context.

##### Info badges

Informational badges help to highlight some information as particularly important. They draw attention to the badge without stating whether it was positive or a potential problem.

##### Success badges

Success badges help to highlight something desirable has happened or will happen. You can use them in situations like a confirmation of a user action (such as published job in TTN or paid status in PoP).

##### Warning badges

Warning badges highlight information that might have a negative impact on the user but isn’t critical. They’re associated with negative emotions so only use them occasionally to stop potential problems before they happen.

##### Critical/Error badges

Critical badges call attention to problems that require immediate attention from the user. These badges create feelings of stress so only use them for issues where they’re truly necessary.

### Accessibility

:::note A badge’s meaning should not be communicated by colour alone

Support the meaning of a badge with appropriate text or an icon. This helps users who cannot see color, or who are using assistive technology.

Any badge text must provide an indication of the status conveyed by the badge regardless of the color used. If using an accompanying icon,
its meaning must be visually self-evident and commonly used in that context.

:::

:::note Ensure each badge meets the appropriate level of contrast

All badges added to the design system should meet the minimum required contrast ratio of 4:5:1 on all sizes.

:::

:::note Screen readers

The accessible text that will be read by screen readers should also include context.
For example, if the element on page associated to the badge does not include context, then dsignify this within the badge 'e-learning article' not just 'e-learning'.
