# Time Picker

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>


Time Picker is an input field for entering or selecting a specific time.

### Structure

- **Label:** Labels should indicate what information the field requires. The label is left-aligned above the input area.
- **Time input field:** Selecting this field opens the select menu showing available times on the selected date. Once a time is selected, the option will be shown in the text input. This example shows time formatted in AM/PM but this can be customized using the timeFormat prop.
- **Time dropdown:** Contains the list of all selectable times. This example shows time increments of 30 minutes but can be customized using the times prop.

### Guidelines

The time can be entered directly using a keyboard or by choosing a value from a set of predefined options presented in an overlay. The overlay opens when the field is clicked or any input is entered when the field is focused.

#### When to use

- Use Time Picker when the user needs to choose a time of day.

#### When not to use

- Don’t use it for durations, such as for a stopwatch or timer.

### Behaviour

#### Time formats

TimePicker supports customising the format of times. Formats are given as strings and use the syntax specified at Modern JavaScript Date Utility Library.

`timeFormat` determined how times are formatted.
Where possible use locale for time formatting, instead of a custom format.

Time formats should be informed by the user’s locale and the use case.

#### Validation

##### Min and Max Values

You can define a `min` and `max` value for Time Picker if you need to restrict the input to a specific range:

### Content

- Ensure that locale is appropriately set so that users see times in a familiar format.
- If helper text is necessary, place helper text below the input.
- Use a concise label to indicate what the time selection refers to.

### Accessibility

Label attributes for screen readers should be included for users who use screen readers to understand what the time picker relates to.
