# Nav bar

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>

The nav bar enables us to provide application-level navigation on web. It persists across all pages on applications where it is used.

### Structure

- **Bar** The background on the nav bar. Scrollable if there are more items in the bar than fit in the viewport
- **Buttons** Navigation buttons, containing an icon and a label. Interacting with the button either navigates to that area of the application or opens a navigation sub-menu
- **Menu** Optionally, a flyout menu launched by interacting with a navigation button, containing secondary level navigation

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use as the main navigation method in the scope of a whole application, where there are multiple distict areas for a user to move between

#### When not to use

- Never use the nav bar as secondary navigation (i.e. in situations where there is alternative top-level navigation present)
- Do not use the nav bar if there is only one distinct area in the application. If there are a small number of areas, consider carefully whether there are other alternatives for organising the application without using the nav bar

### Content

#### Icons

- All buttons/links in the nav bar must have an icon. Make sure you [check our list of icons](./icon), and use a consistent icon/concept.

#### Labels

- All buttons/links in the nav bar must have a label. Favour labels that fit on a single row wherever possible.

#### Navigation sub-menus

- Use a sub-menu when there is more than distinct one page within a single area, and those pages are at the same level of the hierarchy. Consider whether those pages should be collated in a way that enables them to be used together or be summarised in a top-level destination before defaulting immediately to a sub-menu.

### Accessibility

- Ensure that the current selection of the nav bar, and the currently focussed nav bar item, are both clearly visible and distinct
- The nav bar must be navigable using the keyboard, and not require a pointing device/touch.
