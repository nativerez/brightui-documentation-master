# Toast

<Tabs defaultValue="design">
  <TabItem value="design" label="Design" default>


A toast displays a short system message as a result of a user's action.

### Structure

- **Container:** Wraps the content.
- **Message:** Text content indicating the purpose and potential next steps.
- **Action** (optional): A single text action a user can take based on the content of the toast.
- **Dismiss button:** Removes the toast for a user.

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Provide a contextual message based on a user's action in the same view the action took place.

#### When not to use

- If you need to communicate an error to a user, consider using a danger or warning [Alert](./alert) instead.
- If there's a page refresh, or a message needs to be communicated after a user visits a new page, consider using an [Alert](./alert) instead.
- If the action is irreversible, consider using a [Modal](./modal) instead.

#### Variants

- Information
- Information (Branded)
- Success
- Warning
- Error

### Behaviour

A toast appears with an ease-in animation from the bottom of the viewport after a user's action.

A user can dismiss the toast by clicking the “dismiss” icon button.
If left alone, a toast without an action will disappear after five seconds.

Hovering over a toast causes it to remain until the cursor is moved.
A toast with an action is only dismissed when a user does one of the following:

- Clicks the action.
- Clicks the dismiss button.
- Navigates to another page.

#### Placement

Centered at the bottom of the viewport for smaller breakpoints and bottom left of the viewport for larger breakpoints.

Multiple toasts stack vertically from top to bottom with the oldest on top.

### Content

The message should be concise, specific, and use clear language.
