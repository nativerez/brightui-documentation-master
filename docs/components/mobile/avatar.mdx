### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use an avatar to consistently represent a person or group where the visual or semantic relationship provides context to the content it's in proximity to.

#### When not to use

- An avatar only represents a user or group. Consider an icon to visually represent interactive elements or other metaphors.

#### Variants

- Placeholder
- Initials only
- Image

#### Sizes

- The size of an avatar varies depending upon its context.
- Available sizes (in pixels): 32, 48, 64, 80.

### Behaviour

#### Single

A standalone avatar without adjacent descriptive text must use a tooltip clarifying what it represents.

#### Groups

- A collection of avatars without labels can be grouped.
- When the group wraps to more than one line use a text action to show and hide additional avatars.
- Use "+# more" to expand the group. Replace "#" with the number of avatars that aren't visible.
- Use "- show less" to collapse the group.

#### Stacks

- Avatars form a horizontal stack when space is especially limited.
- The number of avatars in a stack is variable, but should never cause wrapping.
- Use a badge after the last avatar to display the number of avatars that aren't visible. It can optionally be an action that leads a user to more context for all associated avatars. The badge and avatar sizes should be the same.

#### Accessibility

- A standalone avatar image should use a descriptive alt tag where the content matches that of the tooltip. See the behavior section for more about the use of a tooltip.
- If an avatar image is adjacent to descriptive text, like a user or project name, it should use an empty alt tag so it can be ignored by a screen reader.
