# Checkbox

Enables users to pick multiple options from a group.

### Structure

- **Checkbox Controller:** The element that provides the visual affordance for the control.
- **Label:** Text indicating the option.
- **Description:** Used to further clarify an option.

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- To present multiple options that are not mutually exclusive.
- To allow users to select or deselect options easily and quickly.
- To offer help or error handling for simple settings.
- For changes that require confirmation after selection.

#### When not to use

- When only one of multiple options can be selected—use a radio.
- You want to group multiple options together into a single basic choice—use a choice group.
- For single on/off settings with an instant response—use a switch.
- do not use for more than four options - use a dropdown here instead.

### Behaviour

#### Support progressive disclosure

While it makes sense to provide users with the information they need to make a good choice, providing them with too much information at once actually makes it harder to decide.

So while you might be tempted to stuff everything into labels and additional info, you should try to use progressive disclosure. This means using text links and tooltips to keep info hidden but close by.

##### Do

Present only absolutely necessary information with interactions to offer more.

##### Don’t

Don’t overwhelm users with too much information at once.

#### Considerations

- A checkbox component should indicate the selected state with a checkmark icon inside the box.
- A checkbox component should indicate the indeterminate state (when some but not all sub-options are selected) with a dash icon inside the box.
- A checkbox component should indicate the disabled state (when the option is not available) with a grayed-out box and label.

### Content

#### Write positive labels

In addition to writing positively in general, you should especially focus on positive labels for checkboxes. Focus on what happens when the checkbox is selected. Don’t use the selected state for turning off features.

### Accessibility

- A checkbox component should have a descriptive and unique label that can be read by screen readers.
- A checkbox component should have a large enough touch target area that can be easily tapped by users with different finger sizes and abilities (A minimum of 44px).
- A checkbox component should support keyboard navigation and selection with the Tab and Space keys.
