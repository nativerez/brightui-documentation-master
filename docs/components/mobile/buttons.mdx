# Buttons

Provides an interaction focal point for an action a user can take, such an initiate a process, take a next step, or confirm an action.

There are two main types of button used in our mobile apps 
- button (which sits in the content of a view)
- floating action button (which sits on top of the content)

### Structure

#### Button

- Text: Describes the action that interacting with the button will result in. Should start with a verb.
- Icon: (Optional) Provides additional context to the action. 

#### FAB

- Icon: Provides an indication of what the floating action button will result in
- Text: (Optional) Describes the action that interacting with the button will result in. Should start with a verb.

### Guidelines

#### When to use a button

- Use a button when the action applies to the content within the view: such as within a panel or as part of a form.

#### When to use a FAB

- Use a FAB when the action applies to whole view: such as adding an item to a list

#### When not to use a FAB or a button

- If displaying a data point that will result will be navigating elsewhere in the app, use a [link](./button-link.mdx) instead.

### Rules around primary buttons, use of icons

[Guidance around buttons](../web/button.mdx) in general applies equally to native mobile apps and to web. Use this guidance to consider whether to use a primary, secondary, or destructive button, along with when to disable buttons
