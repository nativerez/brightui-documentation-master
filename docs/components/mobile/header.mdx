# Header

The header gives context to the current view, and easy access to relevant navigation and actions. The application header (HR only) communicates the current logged-in user, and provides quick access to key navigation actions

### Structure

- Xing: The Bright logo
- Welcome header: Containing the logged-in user's first name
- Avatar: Avatar for the current logged-in user, offering navigation to the user profile
- Status icon & description: Indicating the current working location of the user, and allowing for editing
- Burger menu: Icon, invoking a menu

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- Use the HR application header on the main page of the HR app only

#### When not to use 

- Don't use the HR application header within any of the HR app, except for the main page. For navigation and quick actions, use the [top nav](./top-nav.mdx) instead.
