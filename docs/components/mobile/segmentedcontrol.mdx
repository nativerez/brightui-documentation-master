# Segmented Controls 
A segmented control offers users multiple choices via a linear set of two or more segments.

### Structure 
- **Segment**: A segment is similar to a button, it contains a label and/or optional icon. 
- **Segmented control**: A segmented control contains two or more segments within a single line, all segments are equal in width.  
- **Label**: This represents the content within the tab. This label should be be 14 characters or fewer. 
- **Active Indicator**: The active segment will display as a button in Primary 700, with white text. Only one segment can be active at a time. 

### Guidelines 

#### When to use

- Use Segmented controls to divide content closely related on a singular screen, allowing the user to easily switch between views. 
- When the view can be divided into two or three segments. 

#### When not to use

- Don't use this to divide content that is not related to each other, consider putting these onto separate screens. 
- Don't use segmented controls if the content needs to be viewed together, consider using accordions for this. 

### Behaviour 

- Only one segment can be active at any time. 
- A segment displays its content when tapped & changes to an active state.
- All segments shall display as an equal size. 
- A segmented control should have no more than 2 or 3 segments. 
- Segmented controls should span the full width of the screen (with the standard margin). 
- The segmented control can switch views based on a tap or swipe motion. When the moving segment the 'active state' will display a slide animation as it moves to sit behind the correct segment. 
- Some screen sizes will evoke the segment content to span across two lines. This will be centred vertically. 

### Content

#### Keep it consistent with icons or text 
For each segment, use only icons or only text. Avoid using an icon for one segment & text for another, as this can lead to a confusing, disconnected interface. 

#### Keep it short and clear 
Mobile devices have limited screen estate, the name of a segment should be both short to avoid using unnecessary space & clear so the user can understand the type of content contained within the segment.
