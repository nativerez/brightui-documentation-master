### Structure

- Caret: Identifies when the accordion is open or closed. Pointing up in open. Pointing down is closed.
- Title: Identifies the title of the accordion.
- Status Badge: Indicates how many items are inside the accordion.

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- You have long sections of content with similar structure, such as employees within teams.
- You want to show only one section at a time (to keep users from being overwhelmed to support progressive disclosure).

#### When not to use

- You want to display all content on the screen at once—use a card.
- Each section has a single associated action—use a tile.
- The information to hide is simple and doesn’t have a repeating structure—use a collapse.

### Behaviour

- Opening an accordion will exapand to show information within it. Information will open below the title.
- Screen scroll position is saved when opening an accordion.

### Accessibility

_Screen reader considerations:_

The accordian title should have a label to indicate that it can be clicked to open.

_Visual considerations:_

The contrast ratio between text on the accordian and the background must be at least 4.5:1.
Users should be able to resize the accordian up to 200%.
chevron icon must always changed from up for open and down for closed.
Accordian must have a minimum tappable area of 44px.
