### Structure

- **Icon** (true/false)
- **Title** (true/false)
- **Description**

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- When you want to interrupt a user’s journey with relevant information. For things like status messages and additional explanations.

#### When not to use

- When there are already many on the screen. Don’t overwhelm the user.
- For messages that shouldn’t interrupt the flow—consider heading and text.
- When no results match a user query—use an empty state.
- When a user has to solve an issue as soon as possible—use a modal.

#### Variants

- Information
- Success
- Warning
- Error

#### Sizes

- With a title and Icon
- With description only

### Behaviour

#### Use more than just one colour

To maximize accessibility, make sure the message is clear from the content. Icons can also support the message. Color alone doesn't always distinguish different alert types.

#### Include ability to dismiss message

Provide a clear action to dismiss the alert. This should be a text button to not take up too much real estate and distract from the message of the alert.

#### Accessibility

- If sticky positioning is used, the user must still be able to access and view focusable elements the Alert may be covering.-- If an avatar image is adjacent to descriptive text, like a user or project name, it should use an empty alt tag so it can be ignored by a screen reader.
- An Alert is separate from, but complimentary to validation error messages. In this way an Alert announces that there are validation errors and links a user to each instance.
