# Spinners

A spinner is an animated indicator to inform users that a task or page is loading. This helps to maintain user engagement and prevent frustration during wait times. Other types of loading progress indicators for mobile include skeleton states.

### Structure

A circular track that fills itself clockwise.

### Guidelines

#### When to use

- When a page is loading, show a spinner to show the task of running the page ( or task) is active and the app hasn't frozen.
- Start the spinner when a task has or is loading. Stop as soon as all content is fully loaded.
- When you wish to communicate to a user that an asynchronous task with an unquantifiable ending is occurring (such as loading a page).

#### When not to use

- Do not use for specific component interactions. Such as loading images/icons inside a card or inside button boundaries after being tapped and in an active state.
- Do not use on the starting page of a task or journey (always continue on from a users tapping of a button and display the spinner as the new page loads).
- Do not use to communicate the progress of a determinate task with a well-defined duration (such as file conversions). Instead, use a progress indicator.

### Behaviour

- Keep all spinners generic and do not use additional text such as 'loading' or 'please wait'.
- Ensure that the spinners have a consistent size, weight and colour throughout the app to achieve a recognisable pattern.
- Block user interaction with elements on the page when a spinner is present.

#### Accessibility

- Ensure the spinner has suitable alt text for screen readers to describe the spinner's purpose.
- Ensure the spinner has an appropriate contrast to the page background.
