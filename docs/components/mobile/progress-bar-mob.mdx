# Progress bar

Progress indicators communicate to the user that the app hasn't stalled and content is being loaded.

### Structure 

- **Track**: This track displays the progress made (from 0 - 100%)
- **Progress bar**: This bar travels across the track as progress in made loading the content.

### Guidelines

#### When to use 

- Use a progress bar when a user requests an action and you need to communicate to a user how much of this action has been completed.

#### When not to use 

- Do not use for communicating the progress of a whole page or component loading, use a spinner instead.

### Behaviour 

- As content is loaded, animate the bar progressing through the track.
- Do not show figures such as percentages, this is purely a visual communication to the user.

### Accessibility 

- The track and the bar need to have a contrast ratio of atleast 4:5:1 in order to properly communicate the progress of the bar along the track.
