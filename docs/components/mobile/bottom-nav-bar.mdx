### Structure 

The bottom navigation bar consists of 4 navigation items & an optional FAB, depending on the area of the product. 

- **Iconography**: Use clear, recognizable icons for each navigation option. Icons should be meaningful and a clear representation of the area.
- **Labels**: Labels should always be paired with an icon in the navigation bar, this ensures the user can distinguish the areas they can navigate to. 
- **Spacing**: There should be consistent spacing between navigation items to create comfortable touch targets.
- **Active State**: When in an area, the navigation item should display a horizontal line in Primary 700 above the icon.
- **Overflow Menu**: If there are more navigation items than can comfortably fit on the bar, this will fall into an overflow "menu" or "more" option.
- **Badges**: Small badges can be present on the icons, positioned on the top righthand side. Badges would usually display numbers. 

### Guidelines & Behaviour 

- Only one navigation item can be active at one time. 
- Navigation items are triggered by tapping on them. 
- Each navigation item triggers a bottom sheet, when a bottom sheet is triggered the bottom navigation bar is hidden. 
- Navigation items can display badges if necessary, to alert users of new information or action needed. 


### Accessibility

- Contrast: Ensure sufficient contrast between icons, labels, and background for improved readability.
- Text Alternative: Provide text alternatives for icons to support users who rely on screen readers.
