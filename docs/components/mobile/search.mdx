# Search

The search input is used to enable users to enter text, and receive back a collection of results matching that text.

### Structure 

- **Icon**: Magnifying glass icon indicating the purpose of the field
- **Input**: A text input enabling a search term to be entered
- **Clear**: A clear icon, enabling the input to be cleared

### Guidelines

#### When to use 

Use the search input whenever you have a set of items available, and you want to enable users to enter a word or words and retrieve items that match.

The search input can be used either for performing a search (i.e. no results are visible, and matching results are returned after the search has taken place) or a filter (i.e. results are visible, and the list is reduced to match the search term).

### Outlined vs solid appearance

Use the outlined appearance for the search box

### Behaviour

#### Interactions

On focus, show the native keyboard for text entry
When there is content in the field, show the clear icon on the right of the field
On tap of the clear icon, clear the contents of the search field and remove the clear icon

#### Using with / without a button

The search box can be used without a commit button, if search results (or a filtered set) are provided immediately when the characters in the field change.

If results can't be provided until the term is submitted to the back end, provide a button with an appropriate label in close proximity to the field. Leave the search term within the input after the button has been clicked.
