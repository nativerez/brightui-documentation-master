# Toggle switch
A toggle is used to switch between two states, typically representing an on/off or active/inactive state.

### Guidelines 

The toggle is represented as a switch that can be physically moved or clicked/tapped to change its state. It visually indicates the current state through its position and appearance.

#### When to use

- To enable users to change a single setting.
- When the result of turning the setting on and off is clear.
- For changes that have an instant response (such as disabling a form field).

#### When not to use

- To present multiple options—use a choice group.
- For settings that require additional help or error handling—use a checkbox.
- For changes that require an additional confirmation (saving or submitting)—use a checkbox.

### Behaviour 

**Use for immediate changes**
Switches are digital on/off switches. They prompt users to choose between two mutually exclusive options and always have a default value. Switches should provide immediate results, giving users the freedom to control their preferences as needed.



### Content

**Use labels**
- Keep labels for switches short and direct.
- The switch labels should describe what the control will do when the switch is on; they should not be neutral or ambiguous. When in doubt, say the label aloud and append "on/off" to the end. If it doesn't make sense, then rewrite the label.
