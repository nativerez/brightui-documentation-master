### Structure 

- **Bottom Sheet**: A container that appears at the bottom of the screen and contains various sections or options.
- **Header**: A Header to desicribe the child elements within the bottom sheet.
- **Dismiss**: Users have the option to dismiss the bottom sheet.

### Guidelines

#### When to use 
Use a bottom sheet to organize and present related content or options that are not required to be displayed together on a single page.

#### When not to use 

- Avoid using a bottom sheet to organize unrelated content or options. Instead, consider using separate pages or sections within the app.
- Avoid using a bottom sheet for content that needs to be viewed together. In such cases, an accordion or another suitable component may be more appropriate.

### Behaviour 

- A bottom sheet is a modal and creates a a focus experience for users. 
- A bottom sheet slides out from the bottom of the screen in 3000ms but does not cover the entire screen. A sheet allows some of the parent view to remain visible, helping people retain their original context as they interact with the sheet.
- Child elements can be passed into the body of the bottom sheet. These child elements must conform to the guidelines set out in this documentation.
- Users can dismiss the bottom sheet by tapping the 'dismiss' action, or by tapping out of the modal area.

### Content 

#### Keep it short and clear

Mobile devices have limited screen estate, the name of a bottom sheet should be both short to avoid using unnecessary space & clear so the user can understand the type of content contained within the bottom sheet.
