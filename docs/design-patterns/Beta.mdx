# Beta 

When launching a product into beta, it is important we inform users. It indicates that the feature is not yet fully developed and may contain bugs or other issues that could impact its functionality. 

## Guidelines

- A beta feature should always use the solid pink interactive pill to inform the user, within the page. This can then be paired with any of the other logos. 
- There should always be an informational alert banner paired along side this. 
- A beta feature should never use a non interactive logo on its own. 
- A beta logo should never be used in Labs - use the Labs version of the logo instead.

## Behaviour

### Beta logos 
There are 3 types of Beta logo 

#### Primary pill 

This pill has a solid pink background & is interactive, all features launching in beta need one. 

- Upon click, an information modal should display with the following text
> "This feature is currently in beta testing, which means it's not quite finished yet. There may be some bugs or glitches that could affect its performance or functionality. But don't worry, we're working hard to iron out any issues.
If you decide to use this feature, keep in mind that it's intended for testing purposes only and shouldn't be used for critical tasks. Please report any issues or feedback you have during the beta testing period, as this helps us improve the software and make it better for everyone."
- This logo should only ever feature on the page. 
- This logo should never be nested into another interactive component, such as a tab. 

#### Secondary pill 
TBC

#### Logo 

This logo has no background & is used to visually inform the user that the feature is in Beta. 

- There is no interactive state for this component 
- This logo can be nestted into anothre interactive component, such as a tab.
