# Empty States

Empty states should show when there is no available data to display. We use them to first inform of nonexistent data and then guide our users to take action.

## Guidelines

Empty states can occur when:

- a user is setting up or using the product for the first time.
- data is deleted, unavailable, or nonexistent.

## View types

- Full page e.g. bulk upload no data filled
- Component level e.g. in a table, in a side panel like notes

## Anatomy

Possible elements of an empty state include:

- Visual. Illustration that relates to the situation at hand.
- Headline. Use to explain the situation at hand.
- Body (optional). Use to direct users and explain how the user can populate the screen.
- Primary CTA (optional). Use to help the user take an action to resolve the empty state.
- Text link (optional). Use to provide additional user support, like documentation.

### Illustrations

##### Context

- Ensure the illustration conveys the context of the empty state: this can be through what the user may expect to see when filled or what the action is to fill the empty state

##### Styling

- Use a circle in the background with colour ramp neutral-100
- Use a sparing amount of colour ramp primary-500 to indicate some action can be taken to fill the empty state
- Use the dots, circles, crosses flecks

##### Current Variations

- No assignments - (no-assignments)
- No search results - (no-search-results)
- No applicants - (no-applicants)
- No items - (no-items)
- No documents - (no-documents)
- No files uploaded - (no-files-uploaded)
- No notes - (no-notes)
- No address - (no-address)
- No data - (no-data)
- No rota - (no-rota)
- No shifts - (no-shifts)

### Content

The content should always aim to explain the situation at hand and be informative to our users about how they can populate the screen, should they wish to.

##### Copy & Tone

Tone should be educational and plain-spoken.

<TwoColGrid>

:::tip Do

Use an educational and plain-spoken tone.

:::

:::danger Don't

Use excessive emotion or exceed 1 line for headline and 2 lines for body.

##### Headline text

Limit headline text to one line. Since users typically skim online content, the headline should contain the most important information.

- For an onboarding experience: Explain what eventually populates the empty state.
- For a no results/data experience: Explain what happened.

##### Body copy

Limit body copy to two lines. Use the body copy to introduce additional information about what the user can do with this UI element.

- For an onboarding empty state: Describe how a feature works or what will happen when they use it, and what data the user expects to appear.
- For a no results/data experience: Explain what they can do to try and get a different outcome.

### Calls to action

CTAs directly underneath the empty state are optional: they are context driven and should align up with other rules and elements on the page. CTAs should be supplementary to the copy written in the empty state and have a direct action that links to the message given.

<TwoColGrid>

:::tip Do

- Use a primary button if the action allows the user to resolve the empty state.
- Consider a text link to provide additional information if a button cannot resolve the empty state.

:::

:::danger Don't

- Offer a CTA twice on the same screen. Hide the top line primary button when the action is redundant.
