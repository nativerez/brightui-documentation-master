# Vocabulary

The text we use in our products has a big impact on consistency, clarity, and usability. We should use the same word to mean to the same thing everywhere, and not use the same words when we mean something different.

Our writing style gives guidance on how we use capital letters, choose verbs and nouns for our UI, and structure our strings.
